Libraries that are required:
- OpenCV 
- Numpy

run the code using
`python3 maskapple.py`

the video file has to be in the same directory as the main code file.
every background image has to be ideally square and named:

`frame0.jpg`   <- start with frame0.jpg otherwise it won't work
`frame1.jpg`
...
`frame231.jpg`

(go into the code and change the whiteframe_nr variable to the number of frames)
